Developed a ML model to predict credit card defaults using consumer demographics, credit history, and payment habits data. The models are evaluated based on five performance metrics: accuracy, F-1 score, precision, sensitivity, and specificity.
Implemented a voting classifier model achieving high precision, sensitivity, and specificity, offering a strong alternative to individual models. 
Evaluated various ML models to identify the most effective model for predicting default risk, voting classifier performed well in predicting credit card defaults and Random Forest performed well among the individual models achieving an accuracy of 81.3%.
